# Technical Coaching Program

Please follow these instructions to set up your computer for participating in the technical coaching program.

## Purpose

Learn TDD and Emergent Design by Pair Programming on katas.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

* Your Thoughtworks MacBook (please don't use a client machine)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or IntelliJ IDEA

### Installation

1. Update Homebrew
```
brew update
```
2. Install node and npm
```
brew install node npm
```
6. Install the remote collaboration plugin for your IDE:
    - VS Code: install [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
    - IntelliJ: ensure [Code With Me](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-with-me.html) is enabled


### Environment setup

1. Fork repo. Click the Fork button at the top right. See [forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) for further details.

2. Clone your forked repo
```
git clone git@github.com:<username>/technical-coaching.git
```

3. Change directory
```
cd technical-coaching/<kata of choice>
```

4. Ensure you have installed Jest globally if you haven't already
```
npm install jest --global
```
or
```
yarn global add jest
```

5. Open in your favorite IDE
```
code .
```
or
```
idea .
```


## Usage

### Run tests
```
./test.sh
```

### Run tests continuously
```
./test.sh --watch
```

## Katas

### Greeter

#### Before you start:
* **Try not to read ahead.**
* **Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.**
* **Remember the Three Rules of TDD:**
  1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
  2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
  3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

This kata introduces the red-green-refactor workflow of TDD via ping-pong pairing.

1. Write a `Greeter` class with `greet` instance method. Initially, the method receives a `name` as input and outputs `Hello <name>`.
2. `greet` trims the input
3. `greet` capitalizes the first letter of the name
4. `greet` returns `Good morning <name>` when the time is 06:00-12:00
5. `greet` returns `Good evening <name>` when the time is 18:00-22:00
6. `greet` returns `Good night <name>` when the time is 22:00-06:00
7. `greet` logs on console every time it is run


### String Calculator
Made popular by [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/).

#### Before you start:
* **Try not to read ahead.**
* **Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.**
* **Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata**

This kata is one of the simplest and best ways to practice step-by-step fluent tdd, and provides an easy way to get proficient in a language.

Write a method `add` under an object `StringCalculator` that, given a delimited string, returns the sum of the numbers in the string.

1. An empty string returns zero `'' => 0`
2. A single number returns the value `'1' => 1` `'2' => 2`
3. Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum `'1,2' => 3` `'10,20' => 30`
4. Two numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum `'1\n2' => 3`
5. Three numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum `'1\n2,3\n4' => 10`
6. Negative numbers throw an exception with the message `'-1,2,-3' => 'negatives not allowed: -1,-3'`
7. Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored
8. A single char delimiter can be defined on the first line starting with `//` (e.g `//#\n1#2` for a ‘#’ as the delimiter)
9. A multi char delimiter can be defined on the first line starting with `//` (e.g. `//###\n1###2` for ‘###’ as the delimiter)

### Roman Numerals Conversion

1. Given a Roman Numeral, return as an Integer
1. Given an Integer, return as a Roman Numeral

### Extending String Calculator

The purpose of this kata is to demonstrate the importance and value of the SOLID principles.

**Recommended Prework:** Read up on SOLID principles. Some resources:
1. [SOLID Principles in Pictures](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898)
2. [SOLID: The First 5 Principles of OOP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) (examples in PHP)

**The Kata:** Extend string calculator so that it:
1. can add roman numerals
1. can return the result in roman numerals, specified by a command in the string input
1. remembers and adds to a running total
1. can reset the running total, specified by a command in the string input
1. validates input to avoid unexpected behaviour

### Bowling Game
See the original [presentation](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

This kata demonstrates the power of doing tests first, and how up-front design decisions can change
and give way to a simpler implementation by coding iteratively.

Write a `BowlingGame` object with methods `roll(pins)` and `getScore()`.

This will be the game engine which follows the rules of bowling:

* The game consists of 10 frames, in each frame the player has the ability to knock down 10 pins.
* The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down + bonuses for `strikes` and `spares`.
* A `spare` is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in 2 tries. The bonus for a spare is the next roll.
* A `strike` is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in 1 try. The bonus is the next 2 rolls.
* In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare / strike gets an extra roll(s) to complete the frame.
* No more than 3 rolls can be rolled in the 10th frame.
